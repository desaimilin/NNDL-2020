# NNDL-2020
Neural Networks and deep learning are one of the important topics in the data science field for a long time. 
Scientist have been experimenting this concepts from the late 80's. 
However, you can see a huge revolution and industrialization of deep learning concepts in the last decade.
From autonomous vehicle to face lock which you are using in your cell phone.
So that inspired me to take a course in Neural networks and deep learning.
Here I am planning to upload my experiments and journey of learning RNN,CNN and other deep learning concepts along with the basics like updating weights and biases. 
and also playing with neurons and perceptrons.
Very base of the NNDL is neurons and perceptrons. 


In the perceptron section you can find some mathematical formulas for perceptrons using logic gate and graphical representation.
to understand basic concept of the neron and perceptron you can check out this refrence link:

Activation forms are really important in the deep learning network, and by just changing the activation parameter you can manipulate the model's accuracy.
